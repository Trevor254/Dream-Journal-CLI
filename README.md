# Dream-Journal-CLI
a simple yet unique command-line application that helps users track and analyze their dreams over time. Users can log dreams, categorize them by theme (e.g., adventure, nightmare, lucid), and reflect on recurring patterns. The system provides an easy way to revisit past dreams and look for insights into sleep habits or subconscious thoughts.
